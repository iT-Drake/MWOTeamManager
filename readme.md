<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Application](/doc/images/Application.png)

If you are tired of using Excel, Discord pinned messages, text files on your desktop with the dropdecks that you plan to use for the event, or even coming up with them every time just before the drop, then this application is what you need.

It helps you:
- Keep track of your team mech lists (each pilot can update them by copy-pasting content from profile page);
- Create your own database of builds (we all love Grimmechs, but need to store our own ideas somewhere);
- Manage tournaments and events, keep track of attendance;
- Design dropdecks with useful tools that ease the flow of the process.
